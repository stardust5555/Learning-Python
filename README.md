# Learning-Python
After finishing the bootcamp, I've decided to get stuck into learning a new language - Python!

This is a repository I've created so that I can mess around with Python whilst I'm learning. If you want to see a step-by-step guide to creating this repository,  please see the plan.md file. ðŸ˜„ 

So far:
- I've installed all of the necessary things to get going
- Created my first file and have learnt how to run the code in the terminal!
