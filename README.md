# Learning-Python
After finishing the bootcamp, I've decided to get stuck into learning a new language - Python!

This is a repository I've created so that I can mess around with Python whilst I'm learning. If you want to see a step-by-step guide to setting up this repository,  please see the **setUp.md** file. ðŸ˜„ 

Each file covers the basics of python:
- **hello.py** - Just prints the string "Hello World"
- **string.py** - The basics of manipulating and creating strings
- **list.py** - The basics of manipulating and creating lists
- **logic.py** - Creating if statements, while statements and for loops
- **standardInput.py** -  Introduces the idea of a user input into the console
- **scope.py** (Shows how to create a function and redefine a global variable)
etc
