This is my first time using Python in VS code. So I've documented everything I did in this file in case I need to come back to it later. ðŸ˜ƒ

# INSTALLATION
1. Install Python from python.org 
2. Install the Python extension in VS code

# CREATING A FILE
1. Create a file called hello.py
2. Create code that prints "Hello World"
```
msg = "Hello World"
print(msg)
```
# RUNNING CODE
To run the code in the terminal...
## RUN WHOLE FILE 
Right click on the file and say "Run Python File in Terminal"
## RUN ONE LINE
Select one or more lines, then press Shift+Enter or right-click and select Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal.
## REPL TERMINAL
From the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), select the Python: Start REPL command to open a REPL terminal for the currently selected Python interpreter. In the REPL, you can then enter and run lines of code one at a time
## SHORTCUT
If you want to add a shortcut to your keyboard so that you can run the file really quickly: 
    - Go to the command palette (ctrl+shift+P)
    - Enter "run python file in terminal" and click the settings icon on the right hand side
    - You can add your own custon shortcut!
